The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most inﬂuential pandemics in a century. Conventional life has been disrupted on a global scale, with rampant disease transmission leading to an unusual number of deaths. To take measures for this widespread virus transmission, vaccines have been developed since the early emergence of the pandemic. However, due to the substantial burden on the medical community and the gradual collapse of economies worldwide, vaccine testing processes were expedited to stabilize the uncontrolled virus. Development of some vaccines was accelerated by combining multiple phases of vaccine testing by running them in parallel. Once developed, the vaccines received early or limited approval. Yet, the distribution infrastructure and strategies remain un- determined, especially in necessary regions. It has impacted the timely delivery of vaccines to needy people and management to control the pandemic at expected level. This study aims to address some of the deﬁciencies in the administration and distribution infrastruc- ture of vaccines while proposing eﬃcient and systematized strategies.

\section{Introduction}

The COVID-19 vaccines, Covaxin and AstraZeneca Oxford jab, in India are approved for restricted use in an emergency situation in the public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, especially in the context of infection by mutant strains.\footnote{https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55534902}, though there are serious concerns on lack of evidence and unsatisfactory scientific evidence of safety and efficacy for the vaccines produced in India.\footnote{bae 2020 challenges} 

India planned to vaccinate about 300 million people during January to July 2021, first vaccinating people above age 50. India is the second most populated nation, and most of the population is in rural and remote areas. The vaccination drive needs a strong vaccine intelligence network to ensure last mile delivery of the vaccine. Before that, there needs to be a dedicated focus on filling the gaps in distribution network and resources. Presently, the world’s manufacturing processes as well as supply chains are significantly underprepared for the task of a widespread vaccine distribution in a targeted short period of span [3]. 

COVID-19 vaccine movement in India possesses unknown and unresolved issues that have caused delay in the vaccination. Inefficiency in the supply chain and the lack of adequate infrastructure are primarily impacted on-time delivery of vaccines at different locations. One of the major challenges in the process is cold chain and distribution infrastructure. The existing cold chain in India works only for children and pregnant women vaccines that accounts for around 60 million people. As vaccine production is going on at a large scale, the existing infrastructure is incapable of storing vaccines required for 1.3 billion Indian people.  

Scaling up the cold chain distribution needs ten times more investments in the procurement, distribution, allocation, functionality, and training. Moreover, some vaccines need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures and should be used within a week. These vaccines can be stored for a longer period only in freezer storage. It is a big challenge to conduct such a large scale delivery of vaccines with limited cold storage capacity and inefficient distribution network. \footnote {https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/india-faces-cold-chain-logistics- challenge-for-virus-vaccination}

Moreover, it is essential to follow WHO guidelines for vaccine storage and distribution. According to WHO, the vaccine should be stored at 2-8\degree C [5] at every level of storage as the vaccine crosses different regions. The biological characteristic of the vaccine is impacted if it is exposed to a higher temperature than recommended. Such a vaccine may not be effective for disease prevention, ultimately increasing the demand for dosage and vaccine production. It is challenging in India to maintain and increase the capacity of a stable temperature i.e. cold chain for the existing vaccination program. Hence, coordinated efforts between regional levels is requisite to achieve a stable cold chain with an alternative approach that can offset the vaccine waste.
